## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
[default]
exten => s,1,Dial(Zap/1|30)
exten => s,2,Voicemail(u100)
exten => s,102,Voicemail(b100)
exten => i,1,Voicemail(s0)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for machine learning engineers, data scientists, and software developers who want to build robust software solutions with machine learning components. If you're someone who manages or wants to understand the production life cycle of these systems, you'll find this book useful. Intermediate-level knowledge of Python is necessary.


With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-8).
